# Industrial Safety Gear Detection Using YOLOv8

Welcome to the **Industrial Safety Gear Detection** project! This repository implements YOLOv8 for detecting various safety gears in an industrial environment, aiming to enhance safety compliance and reduce workplace accidents.

## 📖 Overview

This project leverages **YOLOv8**, the latest version of the "You Only Look Once" object detection model, to detect essential safety gear such as helmets, safety vests, goggles, and other protective equipment in real-time. The model ensures that workers in industrial environments are adhering to safety protocols.

## 🔍 Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Detects safety gears with high accuracy using YOLOv8.
- **Multi-Class Detection**: Identifies multiple safety equipment types in one frame.
- **Edge Device Deployment**: Lightweight model for deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, etc.
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable to new gear types and environments with custom training.

## 🎯 Applications

- **Industrial Safety Monitoring**: Ensures workers are wearing proper safety gear in manufacturing, construction, and other hazardous environments.
- **Compliance Enforcement**: Real-time monitoring helps in ensuring compliance with safety regulations.
- **Safety Audits**: Automates safety gear detection for audits and inspections in factories or industrial sites.
